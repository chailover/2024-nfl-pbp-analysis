# NFL Play-by-Play Analysis Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis of NFL play-by-play data.

## Available Notebooks

1. `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial exploration of the play-by-play dataset
2. `02_team_analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of team-specific tendencies and performance
3. `03_situational_analysis.ipynb`: Analysis of situational football aspects
4. `04_offensive_identity.ipynb`: Analysis of offensive identities using clustering

## Working with Notebooks

These notebooks are designed for interactive data analysis. To work with them:

1. Open them in your preferred Jupyter environment (JupyterLab, VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
2. Run cells sequentially to perform the analysis
3. Modify and experiment with the code as needed

## Adding New Notebooks

When creating new analysis notebooks, follow these conventions:

1. Use descriptive names with a consistent numbering scheme
2. Include clear markdown documentation
3. Structure your notebook with clear sections
4. Use the provided utility functions in `scripts/` where appropriate
5. Include visualizations and interpretations of results

## Best Practices

- Use markdown cells to document your analysis process
- Keep code cells focused and modular
- Use the utility functions in the `scripts` directory for consistent analysis
- Include clear visualizations with proper labels and titles
- Document assumptions and limitations of your analysis
- Version control your notebooks (but exclude output cells)
